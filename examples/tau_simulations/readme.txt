These simulations examine the variance in tau (s) between cars when deploying them in a SUMO network.

Two networks are examined - a simple single road network (simple_network) and the huntington colorado network (complex_network). 
The runner files simulates the experiments at varying lengths and plots the mean tau measured along with the standard deviation in each simulation
